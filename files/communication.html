        <h1>Communication</h1>
      <h2> Parent-Staff Communication</h2>
        <p>Communication is ongoing throughout the year. Newsletters, the school website and emails	give you information on current
            themes, activites, and upcoming events. Phone calls and/or emails by classroom teachers to discuss your child's adjustment,
            observations and/or conerns are common. If you feel you need to speak to a teacher or the director, please email or call the office.
            Teachers can be reacehd by phone or email after the school day is over.</p>
        <h2>Assessment	and	Parent-Teacher	Conferences</h2>
        <p> Assesmment is an ongoing process at WUNS. Teachers interact with children in their play, conversations and 
            observations both in the classroom and during outdoor play. Teacehrs keep notes on each child, writing about
            strenghts and weaknesses in all areas of their development. Assessment includes checklists, timelines and 
            examples of the children's writings and pictures. Teaching teams meet weekly to discuss each child and plan activites
            in their program to enhance needed skills for children. </p>
        <p>The school has two Parent Conferneces during the school year. The fall confernece is an infomral, getting-to-know-the-child-and-family
            discussion. The spring conference includes a more detailed, written assessment. A parent-teacher conference can be scheduled
            at any time during the year as needed and by request of parent and/or teachers.
