        <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <h2>How does dispclipine work at WUNS?</h2>
      <p>
        The staff and director at WUNS work to maintain a very positive and nurturing environment for each child. Classroom limits are necessary to provide a sense of order and allow teachers to spend as much time as possible providing a stimulating environment for each child. Our rule of thumb is that children keep themselves safe, keep friends safe, and the toys at school safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The staff is trained to anticipate potentially problematic situations; they remind children of appropriate behavior and redirect or intervene when necessary. In most cases, teachers can stop or re-direct behavior before something negative occurs. If not, teachers will first consult the injured party to make sure they are emotionally and physically okay. Then, they will turn their attention to the child who might need more support in “keeping their friends safe” or, more likely, “keeping their bodies safe” with others. Reflection over what has occurred will lead to discovering other behavior options and resolving things with the peer.

        <h2>What if my child needs personalized help?</h2>
        <p>
          If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety
          of ways, which may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking
            process, build trust, and increase student confidence</li>
          <li>Offering more opportunities for exploration</li>
          <li>Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli</li>
          <li>Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration</li>
          <li>Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in
            order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process</li>
          <li>Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular
            concept, skill, or area of concern</li>
        </ul> <br />
