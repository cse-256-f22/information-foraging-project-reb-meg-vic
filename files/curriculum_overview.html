      <h2>Visual Arts</h2>
      <p>At Washington University Nursery School we offer children many opportunities to express
        themselves creatively and artistically. We value visual arts, music, and dramatic play as
        important building blocks in constructing learning. In the visual arts, the emphasis is on the
        process of exploring materials and how they can be manipulated, rather than the product of those
        manipulations. We allow children the time, space, and freedom necessary to achieve a
        successful and complete experience. These art experiences, whether undertaken independently
        or as part of a group, can help increase a child’s attention span, improve fine motor skills,
        strengthen confidence and emotional well-being while building independence. </p>
