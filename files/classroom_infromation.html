        <b>Two's/Young Three's:</b> Children must turn 3 by February 1 of that	school year. The focus of this class is on social
        development	and	learning through play. Separating from parents, learning to	take direction, and being nurtured by people
        outside	of immediate family are	important milestones for this age. The building	of trust and growing peer awareness
        are	enhanced by	a safe environment that provides a foundation for learning. These children are a part of the Teddy Bears
        classroom when enorlled in the morning session and Panda Bears classroom when enrolled in the afternoon session.
      </p>

     children come to appreciate the value of cooperation and contribution. The childrne are encouraged to take risks, helping them discover

    <p><b>The Bear Tracks</b> program provides an extension of classroom activities for children who are enrolled in the half-day program. Children who attend Bear Tracks are ready for more than half-day classes but perhaps not full-day schedules.</p>
   <p>Bear Tracks is offered Tuesday through Friday, 9:45 a.m. - 12:30 p.m., for afternoon students and Monday through Friday, 11:45 a.m. - 2:30 p.m., for morning students. Parents may enroll their children for participation in Bear Tracks for any or all days it is offered.</p>
    <p>In addition to free choice, outdoor time and a snack, the daily Bear Tracks schedule includes a special activity. These activities are designed to engage a smaller, multi-age group of children in hands-on learning in a specialized content area, such as art, science, movement or literacy. Bear Trackers, for example, might take a nature hike one day, create an art project the next, or dramatize a story in any particular week.</p>
    <p>The main goal for the Bear Tracks program is to continue the progress children are making in their regular classroom within a varied and creative curriculum. Children must be toilet- trained to enroll in Bear Tracks.</p>
